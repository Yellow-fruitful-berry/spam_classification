( http : / / www . cs . ucy . ac . cy / sac99 . html ) sac ' 99 : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ over the past thirteen years , the acm symposium on applied computing ( sac ) has become a primary forum for applied computer scientists and application developers from around the world to interact and present their work . sac ' 99 is sponsored by the acm special interest groups sigada , sigapp , sigbio , and sigcue . authors are invited to contribute original papers in all areas of experimental computing and application development for the technical sessions . there will be a number of special tracks on such issues as programming languages , parallel and distributed computing , mobile and scientific computing , internet and the www , etc . coordination models , languages and applications track : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ a special track on coordination models , languages and applications will be held at sac ' 99 . the term \\\" coordination \\\" here is used in a rather broad sense covering traditional models and languages ( e . g . ones based on the shared dataspace and cham metaphors ) but also other related formalisms such as configuration and architectural description frameworks , systems modeling abstractions and languages , programming skeletons , etc . this track on coordination is held for the second time as part of acm sac 's events . the cfp for the acm sac ' 98 track attracted 33 submissions from 18 countries ; 8 of those submissions were accepted as regular papers and 4 more as short papers . major topics of interest include but are not limited to the following : * novel models , languages , programming and implementation techniques . * relationship with other computational models such as object oriented , declarative ( functional , logic , constraint ) programming or extensions of them with coordination capabilities . * applications ( especially where the industry is involved ) . * theoretical aspects ( semantics , reasoning , verification ) . * software architectures and software engineering techniques . * middleware platforms ( e . g . corba ) . * all aspects related to the modeling of information systems ( groupware , internet and the web , workflow management , cscw ) . track program chair : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ george a . papadopoulos department of computer science university of cyprus 75 kallipoleos str . , p . o . b . 537 cy-1678 , nicosia , cyprus e - mail : george @ cs . ucy . ac . cy tel : + 357 2 338705 / 06 , fax : + 357 2 339062 guidelines for submission : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ original papers from the above-mentioned or other related areas will be considered . this includes three categories of submissions : 1 ) original and unpublished research ; 2 ) reports of innovative computing applications in the arts , sciences , engineering , business , government , education and industry ; and 3 ) reports of successful technology transfer to new problem domains . each submitted paper will be fully refereed and undergo a blind review process by at least three referees . the accepted papers in all categories will be published in the acm sac ' 99 proceedings . there will also be a special issue of the journal of programming languages , chapman & hall ( http : / / www . chapmanhall . com / jp / default . html ) with expanded versions of selected papers from those that will be accepted for this special track as regular papers . submission guidelines must be strictly followed : * submit six ( 6 ) copies of original manuscripts to the sac ' 99 coordination models , languages and applications track program chair ( address shown above ) . alternatively , submit your paper electronically in uuencoded compressed postscript format ; this is strongly encouraged . fax submissions will not be accepted . * the author ( s ) name ( s ) and address ( es ) must not appear in the body of the paper , and self-reference should be in the third person . this is to facilitate blind review . * the body of the paper should not exceed 5 , 000 words ( approximately 15 pages , double-spaced ) . * a separate cover sheet ( in the case of electronic submission this should be sent separately from the main paper ) should show the title of the paper , the author ( s ) name ( s ) and affiliation ( s ) , and the address ( including e-mail , telephone , and fax ) to which correspondence should be sent . * all submissions must be received by august 17 , 1998 . anyone wishing to review papers for this special track should contact the track program chair at the address shown above . important dates : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ * august 17 , 1998 : paper submission . * october 15 , 1998 : author notification . * december 1 , 1998 : camera - ready copy .\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

montreal montreal  canada the coling  acl workshop on multilingual information management is a followon to an nsf  sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada  spain  may    the goal of the workshop was to consider the recent history and likely nearterm future of a number of research areas pertaining to language that are related  but still semiindependent at present   the conclusions have been gathered into a report  to be submitted to the nsf  le  and other funding agencies in europe and north america  for their consideration in setting funding policies and goals  the draft report is now available at http    www  cs  cmu  edu   ref  mlim  at the granada workshop  an international panel of invited experts focused on a set of questions in an attempt to identify the most likely and most effective future directions of computational linguistics research  especially in the context of the need to handle multilingual and multi  modal information  the coling workshop  a followon  has the aim of opening the discussion to the computational linguistics community as a whole  to solicit the comments  additions  feedback  and contributions of everyone  to register  consult the coling  acl home page at http    colingacl   iro  umontreal  ca  workshop description the development of natural language applications which handle multi  lingual and multimodal information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics  over the past  years  a variety of languagerelated capabilities has been developed in areas such as machine translation  information retrieval  and speech recognition  together with core capabilities such as information extraction  summarization  parsing  generation  multimedia planning and integration  statisticsbased methods  ontologies  lexicon construction and lexical representations  and grammar  the next few years will require the extension of these technologies to encompass multilingual and multimodal information  extending current technologies will require integration of the various capabilities into multifunctional natural language systems  however  there is today no clear vision of how these technologies could or should be assembled into a coherent framework  what would be involved in connecting a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine  and then using machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieved text  how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques  what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval  the workshop is organized as a series of discussion sessions  each one devoted to one aspect of computational language  initiated by a report of the discussions at the granada workshop  a report summarizing the discussions at granada is available  see below   enough time for discussion has been scheduled  the discussion will focus on the following fundamental questions    what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication    how can  some of  these functions be integrated in the near future  and what kind of systems will result    what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multilingual and multimodal information  particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in     in particular  we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas  o multilingual resources  lexicons  ontologies  corpora  etc   o information retrieval  especially crosslingual and crossmodal o machine translation  of text and speech o automated  crosslingual  information extraction and summarization o methods and techniques  both statisticsbased and linguisticsbased  o speech recognition and synthesis o multimedia communication  as well as language and speaker identification o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o government policy for future funding the initial findings of the report will form the basis of the discussion  the draft report is now available at http    www  cs  cmu  edu   ref  mlim  major points raised in the discussions will be recorded and included in the report  we eagerly seek your

 i am a cost accountant with a major u  s  corporation and i make pretty good money  when i received the program i grumbled to doris about receiving  junk mail   i made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved  i  knew  it would nt work  doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet  i made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old  i told you so  on her when the thing did nt work    well  the laugh was on me  within two weeks she had received over  responses  within  days she had received over     in   bills  i was shocked  i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would nt work  i am a believer now  i have joined doris in her  hobby   i did have seven more years until retirement  but i think of the  rat race  and it s not for me  we owe it all to mlm  frank t   bel  air  md the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest  lawful  extremely profitable  and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time  i was approached several times before i checked this out  i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required  to my astonishment  i received       in the first  weeks  with money still coming in  sincerely yours  phillip a  brown  esq  not being the gambling type  it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan  but conservative that i am  i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would nt get enough orders to at least get my money back  boy  was i surprised when i found my medium  size post office box crammed with orders  for awhile  it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window  i  ll make more money this year than any  years of my life before  the nice thing about this deal is that it does nt matter where in the u  s  the people live  there simply is nt a better investment with a faster return  mary rockland  lansing  mi i had received this program before  i deleted it  but later i wondered if i should nt have given it a try  of course  i had no idea who to contact to get another copy  so i had to wait until i was emailed another program     months passed then it came    i did nt delete this one     i made more than     on the first try   d  wilburn  muncie  in this is my third time to participate in this plan  we have quit our jobs  and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money  the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it  for your sake  and for your family s sake do nt pass up this golden opportunity  good luck and happy spending  charles fairchild  spokane  wa order your reports today and get started
